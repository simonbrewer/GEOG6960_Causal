## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to look at new method for causal analysis using machine learning algorithms. We'll use a set of synthetic data sets:

## Software for causal ML

Both R and Python have packages that allow you to create SEMs and estimate coefficients based on a dataset.

-   R: **lavaan** and **sem**
-   Python: both Uber (**CausalML**) and Microsoft (**EconML**) have published libraries for causal ML. We'll use **EconML** here. 

First load (or install and load) the relevant packages. We'll need some additional packages to explore the data before model building.

# R

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
```

# Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Meta-learners

Meta-learners refer to a family of different approaches for causal ML. The common theme with these is that they are not tied to a single ML algorithm, but can use pretty much any standard algorithm. We'll look at S- and T-learners here. Meta-learners also include X- and R-learners, with increased complexity (notably in trying to reduce biases). 

### Example data

Let's load the first example dataset (*week11_ex1.csv*). This contains only three variables:

-   `age`: a randomly distributed exogenous variable representing age: $age ~ U(18, 60)$
-   `premum` a random variable representing the treatment (whether an individual was sent the premium offer; roughly 10% of the observations) ($[0,1]$)
-   `revenue` the outcome variable representing revenue obtained from the customer: 
    - Baseline revenue is given as: $y_0 = 10$
    - Revenue is increased for 'premium' customers as $y_1 = y_0 + 0.5$
    - A non-linear age effect is added to the baseline for customers between 30 and 50 years old ($0.1$)
    - A second non-linear age effect is added for 'treated' customers between 35 and 45 years old ($0.3$)
    
The true process is shown by the lines in the figure below. Note that the effect is constant for most of the age range (i.e. the distance between the lines is the same), but increases between 35 and 45 years by 0.3:

![True process for example 1](images/week11_2.png) 

The *effect* can be shown as the difference between these two lines (note the non-linearity). It's this that we'll be trying to model in this section.

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r}
df = read.csv("./data/week11_ex1.csv")
head(df)
```

# Python

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("./data/week11_ex1.csv")
df.head()
```
:::

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r}
ggpairs(df)
```

# Python

```{python}
sns.pairplot(df)
```
:::


As a baseline, let's fit a linear model to these data. To account for the non-constant effect of `age`, we can treat this as a moderator, with an interaction with the treatment (`premium`):

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r}
linear_model = lm(revenue ~ premium * age, df)
summary(linear_model)
```

# Python

```{python}
linear_model = smf.ols('revenue ~ premium * age',
                        data=df).fit()
linear_model.summary().tables[1]
```
:::

The results show a significant treatment effect, but no significance with either `age` or the interaction term. This is fairly understandable: there is no linear trend with age (just the offset for 35 to 45), nor is there any difference in the trends that are fit. 

We can visualize these to show these results: note that there's a fairly large distance between the lines (the `premium` effect), but no real difference in slope:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggeffects)
plot(ggpredict(linear_model, 
               terms = c("age", "premium")), 
     show_data = TRUE)
```

# Python

```{python}
df['mu1_hat'] = linear_model.predict(df.assign(premium=1))
df['mu0_hat'] = linear_model.predict(df.assign(premium=0))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='age', y='revenue', hue='premium', s=40, legend=True)
sns.lineplot(data=df, x='age', y='mu0_hat', label='$\mu_0$')
sns.lineplot(data=df, x='age', y='mu1_hat', label='$\mu_1$')
```
:::

### S-learner

We'll start by fitting a S-learner model. This is the simplest of the causal ML methods, and uses a single ML model, but with the treatment variable included as one of the predictive features. 

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

In Python, we need to first one-hot encode the `premium` variable, then extract the relevant data. 

```{python}
df2 = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['premium'], drop_first=True, dtype=int)
df2.columns

X = df2['age'].to_numpy()
T = df2['premium_True'].to_numpy()
y = df2['revenue'].to_numpy()
```

For a first attempt, we'll use the `Slearner` function from **EconML** together with **scikit-learn**'s decision tree model in the learner. First import this and instantiate it:

```{python}
from econml.metalearners import SLearner
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

s_learner = SLearner(overall_model=DecisionTreeRegressor(min_impurity_decrease=0.001))
```

Now fit it to the data:

```{python}
s_learner.fit(y, T, X=X.reshape(-1, 1))
```

And we can obtain the average treatment effect:

```{python}
s_learner.ate()
```
:::

Now we can visualize the results as the effect (the predicted difference between treated and control:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

```{python}
X_test = np.arange(20,60)
y_test_s_effect = s_learner.effect(X_test.reshape(-1,1))

plt.plot(X_test, y_test_s_effect, label="S-Learner (DT)")
```

:::

Here you can see that the decision tree has picked up on the age effect in the non-treated customers, but not in the treated one. This is due to the imbalanced dataset: there are large difference in the number of customers between the two groups. 

We'll try to improve on this below by using a different learner. But first, let's see what the effect is of using a different algorithm, by using a random forest:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

```{python}
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

s_learner = SLearner(overall_model=RandomForestRegressor(max_depth=4))
s_learner.fit(y, T, X=X.reshape(-1, 1))
```

```{python}
y_test_s_effect = s_learner.effect(X_test.reshape(-1,1))
plt.plot(X_test, y_test_s_effect, label="S-Learner (RF)")
```
:::

This does a better overall job at capturing the effect. There's some noise, particularly in the younger and older ages. Tuning the random forest, or using a different algorithm may help to reduce this. 

### T-learner

The T-learner uses two different models: one for the controls, one for the treatment. This can avoid some of the issues with the S-learner, particularly when one of the groups is sparse.Unlike the S-learner, the treatment variable is not used to fit the model, but to split the data. This allows a greater amount of flexibility as different algorithms can be used for the two groups. Here we'll start with a simple decision tree for each model. 

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

```{python}
from econml.metalearners import TLearner

t_learner = TLearner(models=[DecisionTreeRegressor(min_impurity_decrease=0.001), 
                   DecisionTreeRegressor(min_impurity_decrease=0.001)])
t_learner.fit(y, T, X=X.reshape(-1, 1))
```

```{python}
y_test_t_effect = t_learner.effect(X_test.reshape(-1,1))
plt.plot(X_test, y_test_t_effect, label="T-Learner (DT/DT)")
```
:::

This is much better fit than the equivalent S-learner. By splitting the data, the model is not imbalanced towards the control group. It's a little noisy compared to the true effect, but this could be fixed by reducing the complexity of the decision trees or by replacing one of the trees with a simpler algorithm. 

To illustrate this last point, we'll refit the learner with a learned for the first model (the control group) and a random forest for the second (the treatment group):

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

t_learner = TLearner(models=[LinearRegression(), 
                   RandomForestRegressor(max_depth=4)])
t_learner.fit(y, T, X=X.reshape(-1, 1))
```

```{python}
y_test_t_effect = t_learner.effect(X_test.reshape(-1,1))
plt.plot(X_test, y_test_t_effect, label="T-Learner (LR/RF)")
```
:::

### Metalearner interpretation

Note that you can access the individual models within the learner. This means that you can use the usual set of model interpretation methods (feature importance, partial dependencies, Shapley values). As this model only has a single feature, the importance is not very interesting, but for reference, you can access the values as follows:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

To get the feature importance from the treatment model (the random forest) in the T-learner:


```{python}
t_learner.models[1].feature_importances_
```

And you can plot the partial dependency on `age` (the only feature) with:

```{python}
from sklearn.inspection import PartialDependenceDisplay
PartialDependenceDisplay.from_estimator(t_learner.models[1], X.reshape(-1,1), [0])
```

:::


## Causal Forests

We'll next look at causal forests. These are modifications of random forests designed to best estimate the CATE (the individual or heterogenous treatment effect). As a result, they have a few differences with a traditional RF model:

- All tree splits are chosen to maximize the difference in the treatment effect, not the error against the observed value. In other words, each split divides between a control and treated group, and the value of the split corresponds to the largest difference in the outcome between these groups
- The forests are *honest*: the splitting and the calculation of the difference in effect are carried out using two subsets of data
- The forests usually include cross-fitting: the subsets for splitting and testing are reversed, and the models are averaged

These models have a number of theoretical advantages: they are unbiased estimators and they can be used to generate confidence intervals around the estimated effects

We'll fit one here using the same dataset as in the meta-learner section. 

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

In Python, we can use the `CausalForest` function from **EconML**. This has a very similar interface to the metalearners above:

```{python}
from econml.grf import CausalForest

cf = CausalForest()
cf.fit(X=X.reshape(-1, 1), T=T, y=y)
```

The CATE values can be extracted with `predict()`. To get the ATE:

```{python}
cf.predict(X.reshape(-1, 1)).mean()
```

:::

And the effect can be visualized as before. The results here are smoother than the meta-learners. This is largely a result of the averaging through cross-fitting:

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
# R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
print("Goodbye cruel world")
```

# Python

```{python}
y_test_cf_effect = cf.predict(X_test.reshape(-1, 1))

plt.plot(X_test, y_test_cf_effect, label="Causal Forest")
plt.show()
```
